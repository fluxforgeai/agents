🚀  Hey, I’m **Johan** — part data whisperer, part AI tamer.

By sunrise I’m crunching mine‑safety data for Anglo American; by sunset I’m teaching language models to build an autonomous software agency (because pushing buttons is so 2020).

### What keeps me buzzing
• ⚙️  Automating *everything* – if a task takes more than one click, an agent’s doing it next week.  
• 🐶  Winning over Ally, my rescue Dachshund who still thinks I’m the mailman.  
• 🏋️‍♂️  Dropping 20 kg on a high‑protein, smoked‑short‑rib diet while lifting heavier every week.  
• 💻  Stress‑testing Python 3.12 on a MacBook Pro M3 Max — peak geek bliss.  
• 🚀  Moon‑shot goals: Starlink speed, $1 M revenue by 2025, and zero downtime.

### Side quests
Fixing a 2001 Jaguar rev‑limiter, colorising vintage photos, and sneaking red‑light therapy sessions between deploys. Expect code snippets, carnivore recipes, and the odd Springbok rugby hot‑take.

Follow along. #AutomationOrBust
