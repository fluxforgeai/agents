Adapted from [BBC Good Food](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/banoffee-pie)

## Ingredients

### For the Filling
- 4 bananas, sliced
- 394g caramel or dulce de leche
- 300ml double cream
- 1–2 pieces dark chocolate (optional, for grating)

### For the Pastry
- 100g butter, chilled (plus extra for greasing)
- 200g plain flour
- 1 medium egg, separated
- 1 tbsp golden caster sugar

## Instructions

1. **Make the Pastry:**
   - In a food processor, pulse butter and flour to breadcrumbs. Add egg yolk and sugar, pulse to combine. Add very cold water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing until dough forms. Do not overwork.
   - Knead lightly until smooth, wrap in cling film, and chill for 30 mins.

2. **Blind Bake the Pastry:**
   - Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 4. Grease a 23cm tart tin.
   - Roll out pastry, line the tin, and leave ~0.5cm over the edge. Line with baking parchment, fill with baking beans or rice.
   - Bake for 15 mins. Remove paper/beans, brush with egg white. Return to oven for 15–20 mins more until golden and crisp. Cool completely.

3. **Assembly:**
   - Spread half the caramel on the base. Layer banana slices, cover with remaining caramel. Chill.

4. **Finish:**
   - Whip cream to soft peaks, spread on pie. Grate chocolate over to serve.
